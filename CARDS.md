## Cards (transcribed from wall photos)

Card: Realm  
- Should move its own crypto coin on its own servers (text partially obscured).  
- Each user is their own realm.  
- Mentions: Realm (multiuser?) (Gaston?) (Ant?).  
- Producing Greendale with water fountains (handwritten note).

Card: Hardware  
- MMO events (IRL & online).  
- VR Theater.  
- Story/Adventure & storyline (see map) (scribbled).  
- Bank of Seastead (?) (illegible).  
- Possibly “Architecture” header with grid doodle.

Card: Floorplan/Tile Sketch (grid)  
- Shows a circular hub connected to corridors and rooms.  
- Labels (legible): “Rooms”, “Lake of Purity”, “Pillar”, “Religious” (near a diamond shape), “Mass hall?” (top right, partially cut), “Rooms” (multiple).  
- Other faint labels: “Open to Future”, “Pillar”, “massive”, “hallway”, “forest?” (uncertain).  
- Black circle/hub with vertical shaft/stair detail; lines suggesting pipes or transit.

Card: Dome/Realm Sketch  
- Drawing of a dome/globe with radial segments/platforms and a central vertical support (“stem”). No legible text inside the sketch beyond scribbles.

Card: Lake Map (wall)  
- Large lake outline with islands; blue grid overlay (represents deepsea cables).  
- Square tiles at several grid cells; clusters mostly on the east/center area.  
- These tiles are movable/anchorable along the grid to reposition seasteads.

Notes on legibility  
- Some handwriting is blurry/obscured; above captures what is discernible from the provided photos. If you can reshoot closer or flatter, I can refine the text.
